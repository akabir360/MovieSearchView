# Decisions

## Xcode as Development Environment
- I decided to use Xcode as my development environment since it is the official IDE for developing iOS apps.

## Swift as Programming Language
- I chose to use Swift as my programming language since it is the primary language for iOS development.

## TMDB API as Source of Movie Data
- I decided to use the TMDB API as my source of movie data since it is a popular and reliable source of movie information.

## Third-Party Library for TMDB API
- I chose to use a third-party library like CocoaPods to install and manage the TMDB API client library to make API requests.

By making these decisions, I aimed to create a robust and efficient iOS app that is able to search and display movie information in an intuitive and user-friendly way. I believe that Xcode and Swift are powerful tools that will allow me to create a high-quality app that meets the needs of my target audience. Similarly, by leveraging the TMDB API and using a third-party library, I aim to minimize the amount of time spent on boilerplate code and focus on creating features that add value to the app.
